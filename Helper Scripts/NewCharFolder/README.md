This script is used to create a new EQ folder for a box account.
Rather than copy all the files to a new folder (which sucks up a lot of space), this will make a symbolic folder link and override only the few specific files for the other character account.

Run like so:

`
NewCharFolder.ps1 c:\EQ\folder\path <CharacterName>
`
