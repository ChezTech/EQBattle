This script is used to create a new EQ folder for a box account.
Rather than copy all the files to a new folder (which sucks up a lot of space), this will make a symbolic folder link and override only the few specific files for the other character account.

Run like so:

* Edit `NewCharFolder.ps1` to provide the path to EQ and the character name.
* Open PowerShell window as Admin
* Run `NewCharFolder.ps1`
